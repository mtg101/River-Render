This started as a way to test out doing some effects with 16 column stack rendering. 

Now it's become kinda a little mini-game demo.

And it's become a 14 column stack render. Pixels, plus attrs, plus sprite... all in single frame. Going to 14 not only saves a push/pop, but also the EX AF.

And until / if I put some key instructions in: Z/X moves the boat.
S currently returns to start screen (until I work out collisions).
O/K will one day do speed (hopefully).
